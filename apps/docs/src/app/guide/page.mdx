# Project Guide

MDX files inside the `src/app` directory automatically become part of the navigation tree. Nextra infers the sidebar structure from the filesystem hierarchy.

## Create a New Section

1. Create a folder like `src/app/getting-started`.
2. Add a `page.mdx` file that contains the content for that section.
3. Optionally add more nested files for deeper navigation.

## Front Matter

Use the front matter block at the top of each file to control the page title, description, or custom options such as:

```mdx
---
title: API Reference
description: Learn how to consume the HTTP endpoints.
toc: true
---
```

The `toc` flag enables a table of contents sidebar for long documents.
