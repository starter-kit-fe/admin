# Welcome to VOH Admin Docs

This documentation site now runs on [Nextra 4](https://nextra.site), which brings an App Routerâ€“ready authoring experience on top of Next.js. Write Markdown or MDX inside the `app` directory and Nextra will handle navigation, theming, and layout for you.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€">
  Begin by editing `src/app/page.mdx` or add new `.mdx` files under `src/app` to grow the docs section.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

- Explore the sidebar to discover automatically generated navigation.
- Customize the look & feel in `theme.config.tsx`.
- Add more pages by creating additional MDX files or directories.
